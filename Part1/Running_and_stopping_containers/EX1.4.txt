CMD 1 - This starts the container and lets the application run but curl still isn't installed so it won't run:
docker run -it ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website; done'

CMD 2 - I opened another terminal and Docker Exec into the container so I could add the curl dependancy (bae is the first 3 char of the ContainerID):
docker exec -it bae bash

CMD 3 - Installing curl onto the container:
apt install curl

CMD 4 - Testing the container:
Input website:
helsinki.fi
Searching..
